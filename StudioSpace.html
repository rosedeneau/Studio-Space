Studio Space is the multidisciplinary design practice of Tessa Wegman and
Rose Deneau. Interested in the social conditions and political context of
human spaces, Studio Space was born out of an urgency to create new,
independent spaces for designers, particularly those excluded from
traditional design discourse and the institution.
