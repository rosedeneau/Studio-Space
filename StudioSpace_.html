<h1>Studio Space</h1>
<p>    ______________ is the multidisciplinary design practice of Tessa Wegman and Rose Deneau. Interested in the social conditions and political context of human spaces, Studio Space was born out of an urgency to create new, independent spaces for designers, particularly those excluded from traditional design discourse and the institution.
         They have previously worked with VSA Partners, the Design Museum of Chicago, and Kohler, among others.</p>
